title: "Hi, I'm Gray."
---

I'm a Front-End Developer currently based out of Hanoi, Vietnam.

I work at [Bletchley Park](http://bletchley.co/), where I tend to write a lot of JavaScript. I also do occasional freelance work, which inevitably leads to writing even more JavaScript.

In my free time, I enjoy traveling (40+ countries visited so far), discovering new food, and accumulating more guitars than any one person can reasonably deal with.

This little site is overengineered with [Gatsby](https://bletchley.co), [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/), and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), and the source code is available [here](https://github.com/grayontheweb/portfolio).
