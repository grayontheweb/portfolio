title: "Hi, I'm Gray."
---

I'm a Front-End Developer with six years of experience building MVPs and web apps as a contractor. I currently work at [Bletchley Park](http://bletchley.co/), where I tend to write a lot of JavaScript.

I'm also the Creative Director and a co-founder of [Overmorrow](http://overmorrow.beer), a craft nanobrewery in Hanoi, Vietnam.

In my free time, I enjoy traveling (40+ countries visited so far) and accumulating more guitars than any one person can reasonably deal with.

This tiny site is ludicrously overengineered with [Gatsby](https://bletchley.co), [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/), and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), and the source code is available [here](https://github.com/grayontheweb/portfolio).

If you'd like to get in touch, please feel free to use contact form below.
